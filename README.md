# Improving Robustness of AlphaZero Algorithms to Test-Time Environment Changes
Welcome to the official repository of the paper **Improving Robustness of AlphaZero Algorithms to Test-Time Environment Changes**. In this repo, we provide the code to reproduce our experiments and, more generally, to further experiment with our implementations of the novel Extra-Deep Planning (EDP) planning algorithm, as well as standard AlphaZero (AZ).

## Getting Started
For a quick start, feel free to use the notebook [kaggle.ipynb](kaggle.ipynb) which should run on Kaggle/Google Colab with minimal setup. If you want to run the code locally, follow the instructions below.

### Local Installation
Start by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/albinjal/GeneralAlphaZero.git
cd GeneralAlphaZero
```

You can set up the environment using either Pip or Conda. Choose one of the following methods to install the dependencies:

#### Using Pip

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using Conda
Create and activate the Conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate az10
```
