# Making AlphaZero Algorithms Robust to Test-Time Environment Changes üõ°Ô∏è
Welcome to the official repository of the paper **Making AlphaZero Algorithms Robust to Test-Time Environment Changes**. In this repo, we provide the code and resources to reproduce the experiments and results presented in the paper, as well as experimenting with the implementations of our novel Extra-Deep Planning (EDP) Algorithm and standard AlphaZero (AZ).
